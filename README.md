Currently not very useful; mostly proof of concept


The idea is that hitting `/` in Windows Explorer will put you into 'search mode'. Typing in a query will do an incremental search, selecting files that match any part of your query.
Hitting Enter will set your search query, and at that point you can use n or N to go to the next/previous match.
